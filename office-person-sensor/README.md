ESPHome project that pairs an ESP8266 with a Person sensor sen21231.

This uses ESPHome's `sen21231` component, but hides it. It exposes it's own `binary_sensor` which is updated only when the state changes on the sen21231.

See https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6004207 for a housing / case and additional details.
